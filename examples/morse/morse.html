Phoebe Sexton received so much mail on her 27th birthday, the postman couldn't fit it in her mailbox. A 2006 graduate of Boston University, Sexton moved to Dallas just a few days before her birthday last year. But because she wasn't with her friends to celebrate, she wanted the next best thing - for them to send gifts, cards, and letters through the Postal Service.
<p />

"I called it my mail-order birthday, and I posted on Facebook and e-mailed. I let everyone know I'd really like to get any sort of mail," said Sexton, who sends lots of postcards through the mail herself. "Oh my goodness, the response was insane. . . . I had 80 people respond - I think 21 of the 50 states were represented, and five continents."
<p />
We live in an age when e-mails, texts, and instant messages dominate communication - so much so that the US Postal Service is targeting 3,600 branches for possible closure over the next year because of dwindling revenue. The amount of first-class mail has declined every year since 2005 - last year it fell 6.6 percent, according to the service.

<p />
"One of the main contributors to the decline was a 3.1 billion piece reduction in first-class . . . letters and cards that was driven in part by continuing electronic diversion of mail," the Postal Service said in its 2010 Household Diary Study.

<p />
Yet some young people steadfastly participate in the practice of sending letters via snail mail. While it may be quicker and easier to dash off an e-mail or text message, some folks who grew up in the digital age say they prefer the more tangible human connections and emotions that come from a handwritten note sent through the mail.

<p />
"I'm a very visual, tactile person. I'm a photographer. I like to see stuff, I like to hold stuff in my hand, and the stuff on the Internet - e-mails and Facebook posts - you can't," Sexton said. "I can hold a letter. I can't print my Facebook wall and put it up on my fridge, but right now I have three postcards and a letter and a card up on my fridge."

<p />
Lindsey Warriner, 23, a self-described postcard fanatic who owns a small stationery company called Warren Tales, says she was devastated when she heard that the Postal Service is considering closing so many locations.

<p />
"I feel like it's very isolating, which is strange, because obviously they're cutting the program because people don't send mail - they send e-mail because it's free," said Warriner, who graduated in 2010 from Emerson College and lives in Brookline.

<p />
Warriner says she loves sending postcards to her far-away friends, to let them know she's genuinely thinking of them. She says she has inspired several of her friends to start sending mail in their circles.
